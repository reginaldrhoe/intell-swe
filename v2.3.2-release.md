### [SECURITY] GitHub PAT Token Rotation

**Release Focus**: Regenerate and rotate GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for the rag-poc-release publisher.

### Security Updates

- Regenerated publisher token for rag-poc-release key
- Token has appropriate repository scopes for release publishing
- Old token invalidated to prevent unauthorized access

### Verification

### Compatibility

- All existing features from v2.3.1 remain unchanged
- Service management scripts continue to work as expected

- Release automation pipeline fully operational

### Usage

```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = '<your_repo_scoped_pat>'
.\scripts\publish_github_releases.ps1 -Owner reginaldrhoe -Repo rag-poc
```

### Migration Guide

From v2.3.1 to v2.3.2:
1. Pull latest changes: git pull origin main
2. Verify service status: .\scripts\check_services.ps1
3. No application changes required

### Acknowledgments
